# Verifying Django Behavior

## Issue

Django's documentation states that fields in an abstract model can be overridden by setting them to None in a subclass. However, this does not work for GenericForeignKey. This project provides a script to verify whether ConcreteEntity still contains the related_object field despite being overridden.

## Verification Steps

1. Ensure your Django project is set up and ConcreteEntity is defined.
2. Run the script:

    ```
    python verify_concrete_entity.py
    ```

### Check the output:

If related_object exists, you will see:

```
'related_object' exists in ConcreteEntity: True
```

If it is successfully overridden, you will see:

```
'related_object' exists in ConcreteEntity: False
```
